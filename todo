proper process titles
    not visible by default, only on hover
    and in some other situations (hover on parent long enough, like in baobab)

    create tree of 'dummy' processes
        basically copy all of the names of the processes
        so we can get their names with no lag and no trouble if the
        processes cease to exist after the graph is generated.
    
There should be an update graph button to regenerate the graph.

The program should not hang while the graph is generating.

instead of creating a new wedge class, make it a subclass of matplotlib's Wedge.
