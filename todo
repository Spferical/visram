Hover-on-parent action as in baobab

    When the user hovers the mouse over a process wedge long enough, the
    titles of the major children of that process should appear (if space
    is available).

Only show appropriate colormaps in themes menu

    see http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html

    Just the 'Qualitative' and 'Miscellaneous' colormaps would be good

Make process popup window look nicer

    HTML styling, or showing everything in a table
