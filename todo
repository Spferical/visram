Hover-on-parent action as in baobab
    When the user hovers the mouse over a process wedge long enough, the
    titles of the major children of that process should appear (if space
    is available).

There should be an update graph button to regenerate the graph.

The program should not hang while the graph is generating.

Move from matplotlib to a library better for real-time interactive graphics,
such as pyqtgraph. The current implementation lags on a netbook.
